# Story in Pieces

The world fell apart like a group project started five minutes before the deadline.
Everyone had one piece. No one knew what it was for. One person did all the work. Three people said “I’ll do it later.”
Some pieces almost fit. Most were copied wrong.
The deadline was today.

So what could be done? No way to get a grade good enough to pass the class until then. I had to think oustide the box. Failure is not an option. The only out is through. Come on, think, think! What could I do to get a pass?
My direct colleague tells me about branching. I need to be honest, I don't have any idea of what he is speaking about. He feels confident, but I really don't like to work outside. Then, we use always the same command "gimp" "gimp" "gimp". I was sure it was something about picture editing basically.
